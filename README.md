3. Details of group work activities:

• Planning: 

Step1: We have organized team meeting through Zoom initially to discuss regarding the requirements and tasks sharing. We planned to create a course feedback submission form to showcase the basics of Flask's routing and rendering system. 

Step2: As this a group work, we thought of working on same respository and reffered some online tutorials to learn how multiple developers can work on same code repository using Github. 

For this planning and discussion, we have spend approximately 1 hour 30 minutes of time.

• Developement activities: 

1. One of us created the repository and shared the repository URL to another team member.
2. The other team mate forked the repository and started to make changes to code.
3. After making changes to the source code, we have clicked "Commit Changes" button.


4. Project Introduction: 

This is project is to create a course feedback submission form for our university using basics of Flask's routing and rendering system. We are using Github for source code management and AWS Cloud9 for development activities. This project renders a webpage (templates/index.html), which has the ability to call a function in the app.py.

The output can viewed in output.img file.
